TODO List for PEL
*****************

In addition to the following list, then the source contains a number
of comments beginning with `TODO' and `FIXME' which marks extra places
where attention is needed.

The list has been roughly ordered by priority and the release
targeted.


PEL Version 1.0
---------------

* Add convenience functions.
   It would be nice to have functions that could give you a particular
   entry or the embedded thumbnail with just one function call.
   Manually traversing the directory structure (and repeatedly
   checking for null pointers) requires too big a knowledge of the
   structure of JPEG, TIFF, and Exif formats.


PEL Version 1.x
---------------

* Only load necessary data.
   SF #1210126: instead of parsing the entire JPEG/TIFF image, we
   should load data as necessary.  This will save memory with big
   images.

* Interpret the MakerNotes.
   The libexif project already has code for interpretating the
   MakerNotes for a number of different camera models.

* Handle character encodings of the USER_COMMENT tag.
   The first eight bytes store the character encoding, but PEL ignores
   them for now.  Using the Multibyte String PHP extension we should
   be able to convert the data.

* Deal with characters outside Latin-1 in PelEntryWindowsString.
   This needs testing from people running Windows XP set to a locale
   different from Latin-1.
