# README file for MediaProbe Examples

## MediaProbe Examples

This directory contains various examples of how MediaProbe can be used in
small scripts.  The scripts are meant to be executed from the command
line and they assume that you have PHP installed as /usr/bin/php.  If
that is not the case, then please adjust the first line before
executing the scripts, or simply execute them as

```
% php <script> <arguments>
```

and let your shell find the PHP executable.

The examples are:

* dump-media.php: a simple script that will load a media file and show its
  structure.

  A media file name should be specified on the command line.
